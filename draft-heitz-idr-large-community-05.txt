1.  Introduction

   A Large Community typ is defined that encodes 8 bytes, suitable for
   4-Octet Autonomous System Numbers that require 8 octets of locally
   significant opaque data.  The Large Community is preceded by the with
   Type code [To be assigned by IANA].

   The Large Community is specifically designed to accomodate routing
   policy related to 4-byte ASNs, as it allows operators to specify two
   4-byte ASNs and still have room for 4 bytes for an action.  For
   example, to make a request to AS65551 to add 3 prepends when sending
   a route to AS65536, one might add the Large Community
   65551:303:65536.  AS65551 would publish a list of large communities
   and their associated actions.  The Large Community is opaque.

   To ensure rapid and smooth adoption of the new community attribute,
   it must be as similar to the [RFC1997] community as possible, only
   bigger.

2.  Large BGP Community Attribute

   The Large Community is a transitive optional BGP attribute, with the
   Type Code (suggested 41) to be assigned by IANA.  The attribute
   consists of a set of Large Communities.  All routes with the Large
   Community attribute belong to the communities listed in the
   attribute.

   A single Large Community is encoded as a 16-octet quantity, as
   follows:

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     / |     Type = Large Community    |          Length = 8           |

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Multiple Large Communities sharing the same Global Administrator can
   be encoded as follows:

   Common Header Type:  The Large Community Type

   Common Header Global Administrator:  This sub-field contains an
      Autonomous System number assigned by IANA

   Large Community Local Data part 1:  data set by network operator

   Large Communiy Local Data part 2:  data set by network operator

3.  Textual Representation

   To allow for smooth communication of community settings between ISPs
   and their customers, support for the following textual representation
   is RECOMMENDED.  Equipment vendors MAY provide other textual
   representations.

   The textual representation of the Large Community is A:B:C, where A
   is the Global Administrator number, B is the Local Data part 1 and C
   is the Local Data part 2.  A ranges from 0 to 4294967295.  B ranges
   from 0 to 4294967295.  C ranges from 0 to 4294967295.  A, B and C are
   plain decimal non-negative integers without leading zeroes.  Each
   number must appear, even if it is 0.  For example, "0:1:2" cannot be
   written as ":1:2".  The string is expected to match the following
   regular expression: ^[0-9]+:[0-9]+:[0-9]+$

4.  Error Handling

   The error handling of Large Community is as follows:

   o  The Large Community type SHALL be considered malformed if its
      length is not a non-zero multiple of 8 bytes.

   o  An UPDATE message with a malformed Large Community type SHALL be
      handled using the approach of "treat-as-withdraw" as described in
      section 2 [RFC7606].

5.  Security Considerations

   TBD

6.  Implementation status - RFC EDITOR: REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   As of today these vendors have produced an implementation of Large
   BGP Community:

   o  no known implementations

   The latest implementation news is tracked at
   http://largebgpcommunities.net/ [1].

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a Community Type from the Community Type
   Registry as defined in the BGP Community Common Header .
