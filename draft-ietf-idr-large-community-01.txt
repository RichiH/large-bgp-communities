                         Large BGP Communities
                   draft-ietf-idr-large-community-01

Abstract

   The BGP Communities Attribute [RFC1997] is heavily used by operators,
   but is inadequate to represent large enough values, particularly
   Four-octet Autonomous System numbers [RFC6793] plus additional
   values.  This document describes an extension to BGP [RFC4271] to
   address this need with a new extended form of the BGP Communities
   Attribute.

1.  Introduction

   BGP implementations typically support a routing policy language to
   control the distribution of routing information.  Network operators
   attach BGP communities to routes according to their routing policy to
   identify intrinsic properties of these routes.  These properties may
   include information such as the route origin location, or
   specification of a routing policy action to be taken, or one that has
   been taken, and may apply to an individual route or group of routes.
   Because BGP communities are optional transitive BGP attributes, BGP
   communities may be acted upon or otherwise used by routing policies
   in other Autonomous Systems (AS) on the Internet.

   [RFC1997] BGP Communities Attributes are four-octet values split into
   two separate two-octet words.  The most significant word is usually
   interpreted as an Autonomous System Number (ASN) and the least



Heitz, et al.            Expires March 29, 2017                 [Page 2]

Internet-Draft            Large BGP Communities           September 2016


   significant word is a locally defined value whose meaning is assigned
   by the operator of the Autonomous System to which it applies.

   Since the adoption of four-octet ASNs [RFC6793], the BGP Communities
   Attribute can no longer accommodate this encoding, as the
   specification in [RFC1997] contains only four octets.  This does not
   allow operators to specify any locally significant values.

   To address these shortcomings, this document defines a Large
   Community BGP Attribute to encode one or more 12-octet values, each
   consisting of a four-octet ASN and two four-octet operator-defined
   values, each of which can be used to denote properties or actions
   significant to that ASN.

2.  Large BGP Communities Attribute

   This document creates the Large Communities BGP path attribute as an
   optional transitive attribute of variable length.  All routes with
   the Large Communities attribute belong to the community specified in
   the attribute.

   The Large Communities attribute has Type Code [TBD - RFC EDITOR to
   fill-in IANA assigned value].

   The attribute consists of one or more 12-octet values.  Each 12-octet
   Large Communities value represents three 4-octet values, as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                                 ASN                           |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                         Local Data Part 1                     |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                         Local Data Part 2                     |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   ASN:  The Four-octet Autonomous System Number of the operator with
      whom definition of the final two 4-octet values lies.

   Local Data part 1:  4-octet operator-defined value.

   Local Data part 2:  4-octet operator-defined value.

   It is not a protocol error to put an invalid ASN into the ASN field.
   For example 0 or 23456 are allowed.  It is up to the receiving BGP
   speaker to recognize (or not) any received large communities.  There
   are no routing semantics implied by the ASN field.  For example, this

Internet-Draft            Large BGP Communities           September 2016


   document does not require a receiver of a Large Communities attribute
   to know where the AS identified by the ASN of a Large Communities
   attribute is and to forward the route containing that large community
   towards that AS.  The ASN field is simply a convenience that allows
   different ASes to define large communities without clashing with each
   other.  If an AS wants to use invalid ASNs in the ASN field privately
   within its own AS or even by agreement with a neighboring AS, then
   this document does not prohibit it.

   The large communities are transmitted in the order: ASN, followed by
   part 1, followed by part 2.  Each integer is in network byte order.
   That is, most significant bit first.  The first Large Communities
   attribute immediately follows the BGP path attribute header.  Each
   Large Communities attribute immediately follows the previous one.
   There is no significance to the order in which the large communities
   are transmitted.  Duplicate large communities SHOULD NOT be
   transmitted.  A receiving speaker MAY silently remove duplicate large
   communities and MAY retransmit them in an order different to which it
   received them.

3.  Aggregation

   If a range of routes is to be aggregated and the resultant aggregates
   attribute section does not carry the ATOMIC_AGGREGATE attribute, then
   the resulting aggregate should have a large communities path
   attribute which contains all large communities from all of the
   aggregated routes.

4.  Textual Representation

   The textual representation of BGP Communities [RFC1997] in routing
   policy languages and the networking community is known well as two
   2-octet unsigned integers and is often represented as such, separated
   a colon.  For example, 65000:12345 (ASN:differentia).

   Large Communities MUST be represented similarly, as three 4-octet
   unsigned decimal integers with no leading zeros.  An integer MUST NOT
   be omitted, even when zero.  Implementations MUST represent Large
   Communities in a manner consistent with their representation of BGP
   Communities [RFC1997].  For example, 65000:1:2 (ASN:Local Data Part
   1:Local Data Part 2) or 65000:0:0.

   The following Large BGP Communities textual specification uses the
   Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation as specified in [RFC5234].

           positive-digit  = "1" / "2" / "3" /
                             "4" / "5" / "6" /
                             "7" / "8" / "9"

           digit           = "0" / positive-digit

           non-zero-int    = positive-digit *9digit

           part            = "0" / non-zero-int ; max value is
                             4294967295

           large-community = part ":" part ":" part

   Vendors MAY provide other textual representations.  For example, some
   vendor's routing policy language may use a separator other than a
   colon or may require keywords or characters prepending or postpending
   the Large Communities attribute.  Such differences are permitted.
   However, each implementation MUST make a representation available
   that depicts the intergers in decimal and in the order (ASN:Local
   Data Part 1:Local Data Part 2).

5.  Error Handling

   The error handling of Large Communities is as follows:

   o  A Large Communities BGP Path Attribute with a length of zero MUST
      be ignored upon receipt and removed when sending.

   o  A Large Communities attribute SHALL be considered malformed if its
      length is not a non-zero multiple of 12 bytes.

   o  A BGP UPDATE message with a malformed Large Communities attribute
      SHALL be handled using the approach of "treat-as-withdraw" as
      described in section 2 [RFC7606].

6.  Security Considerations

   This extension to BGP has similar security implications as BGP
   Communities [RFC1997].

   underlying security issues.  Specifically, an AS relying on the BGP
   attributes carried in BGP must have trust in every AS in the path to
   the source of the route, as any AS in the path may have altered or
   deleted attributes or added false attributes.  Specifying the
   mechanism(s) to provide such trust is beyond the scope of this
   document.

7.  Implementation status - RFC EDITOR: REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   As of today these vendors have produced an implementation of Large
   BGP Community:

   o  Cisco IOS XR

   o  ExaBGP

   o  GoBGP

   The latest implementation news is tracked at
   http://largebgpcommunities.net/ [1].

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a BGP path attribute value for the Large
   Communities attribute.
