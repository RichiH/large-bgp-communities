            The BGP Communities Attribute <xref target="RFC1997"/> is heavily
            used by operators, but is inadequate to represent large enough
            values, particularly Four-octet Autonomous System numbers
	    <xref target="RFC6793"/> plus additional values.
            This document describes an extension to BGP <xref target="RFC4271"/>
            to address this need with a new extended form of the BGP community
	    Attribute.

      <section title="Introduction">
          <t>
              BGP implementations typically support a routing policy language
              (RPL) to control the distribution of routing information.
              Network operators add BGP communities to routes via the RPL to
              identify intrinsic differentia of a route such as its origin
              country or specify a RPL action to be taken, or one that has been
              taken, on an individual route or group of routes. Because BGP
              communities are optional transitive BGP attributes, these
              differentia and actions identified by the communities may be
              acted upon or otherwise utilized by the RPL in any Autonomous
              System (AS) in the Internet, often are and often the goal of
	      adding a community is to signal an AS one or more AS-hops away.
          </t>
          <t>
              BGP Communities Attributes are 4-octet values split into two
              2-octet values where the most significant word is an Autonomous
              System number (ASN) and the least significant word is a value
              whose meaning is defined by operators of that Autonomous System.
              This operator-defined value is the aforementioned differentia or
              RPL action.
          </t>
          <t>
              Since the adoption of Four-octet ASNs <xref target="RFC6793"/>,
              the BGP Communities Attribute can no longer accommodate this
              encoding because it is only large enough to hold the ASN.  Some
              operators have also expressed a need for more than 2-octets of
              operator-defined values. This has led operators to create obtuse
              mappings to fit within 2-octets, the use of which are tedious and
              error prone and still can not accommodate all use-cases.
          </t>
          <t>
              To address this, a Large Community BGP attribute is defined to
              encode one or more 12-octet values each consisting of a
              Four-octet Autonomous System Number and two 4 octet
              operator-defined values for differentia or actions defined by
              that Autonomous System.
          </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Large BGP Community Attribute">
        <t>
            This document creates the Large Communities BGP path attribute as
            an optional transitive attribute of variable length.  All routes
            with the Large Community attribute belong to the communities in the
            attribute.
        </t>
        <t>
            The Large COMMUNITIES attribute has Type Code TBD - RFC EDITOR
            fill-in IANA assigned value.
        </t>
        <t>
            The attribute consists of one or more 12-octet values. Each
            12-octet Large Community value represents three 4-octet values, as
            follows:

        <t hangText="Local Data part 1:">4-octet operator-defined value.</t>

        <t>
It is not a protocol error to put an invalid ASN into the ASN field.
For example 0 or 23456 are allowed. It is up to the receiving BGP speaker to
recognize (or not) any received large communities. There are no routing semantics
implied by the ASN field. For example, this document does not require a receiver
of a large community to know where the AS identified by the ASN of a large community is and
to forward the route containing that large community towards that AS.
The ASN field is simply a convenience that allows different ASes to define large communities
without clashing with each other. If an AS wants to use invalid ASNs in the ASN
field privately within its own AS or even by agreement with a neighboring AS, then
this document does not prohibit it.
        </t>
        <t>
The large communities are transmitted in the order: ASN, followed by part 1, followed by part 2.
Each integer is in network byte order.
That is, most significant bit first. The first large community immediately follows the BGP
path attribute header. Each large community immediately follows the previous one. There is no
significance to the order in which the large communities are transmitted. Duplicate
large communities SHOULD NOT be transmitted. A receiving speaker MAY silently remove
duplicate large communities and MAY retransmit them in an order different to which
it received them.
        </t>

    <section title="Aggregatation">
        <t>
   If a range of routes is to be aggregated and the resultant aggregates
   attribute section does not carry the ATOMIC_AGGREGATE attribute, then
   the resulting aggregate should have a large communities path attribute
   which contains all large communities from all of the aggregated routes.
        </t>

    </section>

    <section title="Textual Representation">
        <t>
            The textual representation of BGP Communities <xref target="RFC1997"/>
            in RPLs and the networking community is known well as two 2-octet
            unsigned integers and is often represented as such, separated a
            colon. For example, 65000:12345 (ASN:differentia).
        </t>
        <t>
            Large Communities MUST be represented similarly, as three 4-octet
            unsigned decimal integers with no leading zeros. An integer MUST NOT be
            omitted, even when zero. Implementations MUST represent Large
            Communities in RPL in a manner consistent with their representation
            of BGP Communities <xref target="RFC1997"/>. For example, 65000:1:2
            (ASN:Local Data Part 1:Local Data Part 2) or 65000:0:0.
        </t>
        <t>
The following Large BGP Communities textual specification uses the Augmented
Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation as specified in <xref target="RFC5234"/>.

        digit           = "0" / positive-digit

        non-zero-int    = positive-digit *9digit

        part            = "0" / non-zero-int ; max value is

</t>
        <t>
            Vendors MAY provide other textual representations. For example, some 
vendor's RPL may use a separator other than a colon or may require keywords or
characters prepending or postpending the large community. Such differences are
permitted. However, each implementation MUST make a representation available
that depicts the intergers in decimal and in the order 
(ASN:Local Data Part 1:Local Data Part 2).

                    A Large Community BGP Path Attribute with a length of zero
                    MUST be ignored upon receipt and removed when sending.
                </t>
                <t>
                    A Large Community attribute SHALL be considered malformed
                    if its length is not a non-zero multiple of 12 bytes.
                </t>
                <t>
                    A BGP UPDATE message with a malformed Large Community
                    attribute SHALL be handled using the approach of

    <section title="Security Considerations">
        <t>
            This extension to BGP has similar security implications as BGP
            Communities <xref target="RFC1997"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
            underlying security issues. Specifically, an AS relying on the
	    BGP attributes carried in BGP must have trust in every AS in the
	    path to the source of the route, as any AS in the path may have
	    altered or deleted attributes or added false attributes.
            Specifying the mechanism(s) to provide such trust is beyond the
	    scope of this document.
