1.  Introduction

   A Large Community attribute is defined that encodes 16 bytes
   communities, suitable for 4-Octet Autonomous System Numbers that
   require 8 octets of locally significant opaque data.

   To ensure rapid and smooth adoption of the new community attribute,
   it must be as similar to the [RFC1997] community as possible, only
   bigger.

   Future variants of the Large Community can be accomodated through the
   Subtype extension mechanism.

2.  Large BGP Community Attribute

   The Large Community Attribute is a transitive optional BGP attribute,
   with the Type Code (suggested 41) to be assigned by IANA.  The
   attribute consists of a set of Large Communities.  All routes with
   the Large Community attribute belong to the communities listed in the
   attribute.

   Each Large Community is encoded as a 16-octet quantity, as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |     Flags     |    Subtype    |          Reserved             |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                     Autonomous System number                  |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                         Local Data Part 1                     |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                         Local Data Part 2                     |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Flags:  All undefined flags MUST be set to 0 on transmit and MUST be
      ignored on receipt.

   Subtype:  This field is set to 0 for the community type described in
      this document

   Reserved:  This field MUST be set to 0 on transmit and MUST be
      ignored on receipt.

   Autonomous System Number:  This field indicates the Autonomous System
      in which the Large Community has a meaning.

   Local Data part 1:  data set by network operator

   Local Data part 2:  data set by network operator

2.1.  Flags

   The 'flags' field is an 8-bit field reserved for flags.  Only the
   transitivity flag is defined in this document.  All other bits MUST
   be set to 0 on transmit and MUST be ignored on receipt.

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |T|             |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Internet-Draft             Large BGP Community            September 2016


   The transitivity flag is defined as follows:

   T - transitivity flag

         Value 0: The community is transitive across ASes

         Value 1: The community is non-transitive across ASes

   This document describes a community which is transitive, so the
   T-flag MUST be set to 0.

3.  Textual Representation

   The textual representation of the Large Community is A:B:C, where A
   is the Autonomous System number, B is the Local Data part 1 and C is
   the Local Data part 2.  A ranges from 0 to 4294967295.  B ranges from
   0 to 4294967295.  C ranges from 0 to 4294967295.  A, B and C are
   plain decimal non-negative integers without leading zeroes.  Each
   number must appear, even if it is 0.  For example, "0:1:2" cannot be
   written as ":1:2".  The string is expected to match the following
   regular expression: ^[0-9]+:[0-9]+:[0-9]+$

4.  Security Considerations

   TBD

5.  Implementation status - RFC EDITOR: REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   As of today these vendors have produced an implementation of Large
   BGP Community:

   o  Cisco IOS XR

   o  ExaBGP

   [1].

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a BGP path attribute value for the Large
   Community attribute (suggested 41).

   This document allows for a class of Large Community variants through
   the Subtype field: called the Large Community Variants, for which the
   IANA will create and maintain a registry entitled "Large Community
   Variants".  Future assignments are to be made using the "First Come
   First Served" policy defined in [RFC5226].  Assignments consist of a
   name and the Subtype value.  This document makes the following
   assignment for the Large Community Variants:

                    +-----------------+---------------+
                    | Variant Name    | Subtype Value |
                    +-----------------+---------------+
                    | Large Community | 0x00          |
                    +-----------------+---------------+
